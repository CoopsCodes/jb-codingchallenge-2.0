# JB Hi-Fi Coding Challenge

The purpose of this challenge was to build a webpage that calls the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org) service, allows the user to search a city and country that limits their calls to 5 per hour while handling any rejections/errors.

The repo is located in GitHub at [CoopsCodes Repo](https://github.com/CoopsCodes/jb-codingchallenge-2.0).

## Tech

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Using Axios to make the API call

#  Cloning

To install and run the application open a terminal and run the below command in your terminal

### `git clone https://github.com/CoopsCodes/jb-codingchallenge-2.0.git

# Installing and running the Server

From the terminal change into the following directory with

### `cd jb-codingchallenge-2.0`

From there, change directory into `/Backend` and install the dependencies with `npm install`, once the NPM packages have installed run the server with `npm start`. 

This will display `Listening on port 5000` indicating the server is running.

**Server needs to remain running for the Website to successfully run, so complete the next steps in a *new* terminal.**

# Installing and Running the Website

From a new Terminal change into the frontend directory `/Frontend/frontend` and install the dependencies with the command `npm install`.

Once the dependencies have been installed run the command `npm start`, this will open the Website in a website browser.

If it doesn't automatically generate a website you can follow this [link](http://localhost:3000/).
